# MyCalendar
Hello folks. I'm a swiss student currently studying information science.

Unfortunately, my part time class doesn't exist anymore, since I'm the only student left in there.

This had me come up with a new project: A flask application consuming an ical file and rendering it as a nice html calendar.

Additional features:
* filtering places where courses are taking place
* filtering classes (e.g. the ones i applied to)
* filtering date ranges.

I am very well aware of the fact, that this functionality is available out there, but this looks like fun.
